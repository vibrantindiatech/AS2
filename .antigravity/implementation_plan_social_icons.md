# Implementation Plan - Add Instagram Icon

I have updated the "Secured Network" section on `contact.html` to include *both* the YouTube icon (restored) and a new Instagram icon.

## Changes Made
- Restored the YouTube icon button.
- Added a new Instagram icon button immediately after the YouTube button.

## Verification
- There should now be four icons in the row: LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram.
