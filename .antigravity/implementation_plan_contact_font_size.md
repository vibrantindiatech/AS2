# Implementation Plan - Increase Font Size for Contact Info

I have increased the font sizes in the "Global Headquarters" section of the `contact.html` page to improve visibility.

## Changes Created
- **Global Headquarters Title**: Increased from `default` to `1.8rem`.
- **Subtitle**: Increased from `0.85rem` to `1.1rem`.
- **Section Headers (Corporate Office, etc.)**: Increased from `0.9rem` to `1.2rem`.
- **Content Text**: Increased from `0.8rem` to `1.05rem`.
- **Secured Network Header**: Increased from `0.8rem` to `1rem`.

## Verification
- The text size changes are applied directly via inline styles in `contact.html` to ensure immediate effect and override any conflicting CSS rules.
