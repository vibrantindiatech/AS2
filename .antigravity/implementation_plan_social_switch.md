# Implementation Plan - Switch YouTube to Facebook

I have replaced the YouTube icon with a Facebook icon in the "Secured Network" section of the `contact.html` page, as requested.

## Changes Made
- Located the YouTube icon within the "Secured Network" social links.
- Changed the icon class from `fab fa-youtube` to `fab fa-facebook-f`.

## Verification
- The row of icons should now be: LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram.
